Chitter
=======
About
-------
The weekend challenge from week 4 of Makers Academy was to create a clone of Twitter called 'Chitter'. However I have gone and re-done  the challenge (no styling!) completely in Rails i.e the Rails own test suite instead of Rspec.

Installation
-------
* Clone this repo using `git@github.com:TY231618/chitter-fully-rails.git`
* Move into the new directory using `$ cd chitter-fully-rails`
* Install dependencies using `$ bundle`
* Start the server using `$ rails s`
* Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
* Running tests with `$ bundle exec rake test`

Features:
